    <h1>Privacy Policy for Mneme</h1>
    <p class="date">Last Updated: February 9, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Mneme ("we," "our," or "the App") is a privacy-focused, offline-first memorization tool. We are committed to protecting your personal information and ensuring that your study data remains under your exclusive control. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle data, including local storage, on-device processing, and limited information collected for support.</p>

    <h2>2. Minimal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Mneme is designed to function without tracking your study habits or collecting your flashcard content. We do not require account registration. The only personal data we collect is information you voluntarily provide to us, such as your email address for support or updates.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Local Storage and User Content</h2>
    <p>
        All content you create or import into the App—including text, images, and audio files—is stored locally on your device.
        Your Files: Your flashcards and media remain in your device&rsquo;s internal storage. We do not have access to these files, and they are never uploaded to our servers.
        No Data Sharing: We do not sell, trade, or share your local study data with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>4. On-Device Processing (Google ML Kit)</h2>
    <p>
        Mneme utilizes Google ML Kit to provide features like Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and Image Recognition.
        Privacy by Design: All machine learning processing is performed locally on your device. Your images and audio are not sent to Google or our servers.
        Diagnostics: Google ML Kit may collect some non-identifiable technical metrics (e.g., device model and performance data) to improve its services. This is governed by Google&rsquo;s Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>5. External API Services (OpenTDB)</h2>
    <p>
        The App allows you to download trivia questions from the Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB).
        Internet Connection: When using this feature, the App connects to opentdb.com. This connection inherently shares your IP address with their servers to fulfill the request.
        Scope: No personal flashcards or study progress data is shared with OpenTDB; only the parameters for the requested quiz are sent.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Feedback, Support, and Updates</h2>
    <p>
        If you contact us for feedback or support, we collect your email address.
        Support: We use your email solely to respond to your specific inquiries or bug reports.
        Marketing Updates: If you provide explicit consent (such as checking an "Opt-in" box), we may use your email to send you information about new features or major updates to Mneme.
        Opt-Out: You may opt-out of these communications at any time by contacting us.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        To enable core features, Mneme may request the following permissions:
        Microphone: For recording audio cards and speech-to-text.
        Camera/Gallery: For adding images to flashcards and OCR features.
        Storage: To save and retrieve your study decks. These permissions are used only for on-device functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Mneme does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since the App is offline-first and requires no account creation, it is a safe environment for users of all ages.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Rights and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        You have the right to request the deletion of any email communication you have sent to us. Since all other data is stored locally on your device, you can delete that data at any time by deleting the App or clearing the App's storage in your device settings.
